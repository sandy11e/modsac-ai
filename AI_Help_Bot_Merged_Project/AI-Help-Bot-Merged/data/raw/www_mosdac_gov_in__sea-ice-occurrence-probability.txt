The Sea Ice Occurrence Probability (SIOP36) data were prepared from 36 years (October 1978 to December 2014) NSIDC sea ice concentration (SIC) data over the Antarctic Region (Cavalieri, 1996). The SIC data were downloaded from NSIDC data site:(http://nsidc.org/data (link is external)). The SIOP36 data consist of 366 data files corresponding to 366 days with the first file representing 1st January and the last, 31st December. The file naming nomenclature follows SIOP36_MMDD_S.bin[.tif/.png] format; where MM refers to month number (01 to 12, 01 being January), DD refers to date of the month, and the character S refers to Southern Hemishphere.
Data formats are indicated by .bin (Binary), .tif (GeoTIFF), and .png (Portable Network Graphics). Data is freely available to global scientific community and can be downloaded from www.mosdac.gov.in (link is external). Probability values are calculated from the long-term NASA Team algorithm-derived SMMR-SSM/I-SSMIS sea ice concentration product (Cavalieri, 1996). The dataset is given in Polar Stereographic projection with a grid size of 25km x 25km in latitude and longitude. The grid coordinates of the upper left pixel are 39.2 deg S, 42.2 deg W. There are 316 columns and 332 rows. Data values are stored as IEEE floats representing probabilities in the range 0-100%. Pixels with zero values corresponds to either Antarctic land/ice or ocean water.

Data Version
- SIOP36 (ver BETA)
Data Sources
- The major input data is NASA Team algorithm-derived SMMR-SSM/I-SSMIS sea ice concentration data over Antarctic Region (Cavalieri, 1996) for 36 years (October 1978 to December 2014). The data was downloaded from NSIDC data site: (http://nsidc.org/data).
Processing Steps
- Following are the three major processing steps :
- i. Classification of pixels into sea-ice and non-sea-ice classes.
- ii. Determination of sea-ice-pixel frequency over study period
- iii. Calculation of Sea Ice Probability
- iv. Converting the data into three (.bin, .tif, and .png) formats.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm
- Daily Probability of occurrence of sea ice: Pr = 100 x N / (Y-n)
- where,
- N, is the number of times the pixel has been classified as sea ice (sea ice concentration => 15%);
- Y, is the total possible observations, and
- n is the number of years with data loss on that particular date.
Limitations
- Accuracy assessment of the dataset has not been carried out.
Known problems with data
- The inherent problems of the major input sea ice concentration data (from NSIDC site) may be considered the problems with this dataset.
