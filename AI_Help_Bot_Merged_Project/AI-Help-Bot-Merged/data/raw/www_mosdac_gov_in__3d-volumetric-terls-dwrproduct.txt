These products contain the 3D volumetric gridded de-cluttered radar reflectivity and de-aliased radial velocity generated from the C-Band Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) DWR Volumetric PPI Scan data. The data grid has dimensions of (81x481x481) with a horizontal resolution of (1 km x 1 km) and vertical resolution of (250 m). The maximum altitude considered in while gridding is 20.0 km. This product can be used for various hydrological and numerical weather prediction applications.
Data Access
Data Version
- Version 1.0 (beta)
Data Sources
- TERLS C-Band Doppler Weather Radar (dprf mode)
Processing Steps
- Following are the three major processing steps :
- - The radar reflectivity data is corrected for clutter using a combination of spatial continuity filter and fuzzy-logic based echo classification algorithm.
- - The radial velocity data is dealiased using a 2D multipass velocity dealiasing scheme based spatial continuity of velocity fields
- - The corrected reflectivity and radial velocity from all elevations is then gridded into a 3D volumetric grid having resolution of 250 x 1 km x 1 km.
Derivation Techniques and Algorithm
- Decluttering of Radar reflectivity and Dealiasing of radial velocity; 3D volumetric gridding of radar variables as explained in detail in the above mentioned reports.

| 6 | Abstract | The TERLS DWR data has been processed to correct for clutter and velocity folding prior to their application in hydrological and numerical weather prediction models. The radar reflectivity has been corrected for clutter using a combination of a spatial continuity filter and a fuzzy-logic based echo classification algorithm. The velocity folded regions are dealiased using a 2D multipass velocity dealiasing algorithm. The corrected reflectivity and radial velocity are then gridded into 1 km x 1 km x 250 m 3D volumetric grid which can be used by scientists for further meteorological applications. This data was prepared under the TDP/R&D project “Storm Tracking and Prediction using Doppler Weather Radar |
