The Bay of Bengal's high-resolution sea surface salinity has been reconstructed using a Lagrangian technique leveraging satellite data. The primary input datasets utilized are sea surface salinity data from the SMAP mission and sea surface currents derived from altimetry. These datasets are obtained at a spatial resolution of 25 km. The SMAP mission has been operational since 2015, whereas altimetry-derived sea surface currents have been available since 1993. Validation of this reconstructed product was conducted against in-situ datasets obtained from thermo-salinographs. Results indicate that the reconstructed product more accurately captures front formation compared to the original SMAP salinity fields.

Data Version
- Version 1.0 (beta).
Data Sources
- SMAP Sea Surface Salinity (https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/SMAP_JPL_L3_SSS_CAP_8DAY-RUNNINGMEAN_V5) Altimetry-derived sea surface currents (https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_MY_008_047/).
Processing Steps
- i. Remap Sea Surface Currents with a spatial resolution of 5 km.
- ii. Backward advection of particles from the final time {t} rsub {f} to the initial time {t} rsub {f} -14 , where 14 is the number of days the particles are advected using Runge-Kutta 4th order method.
- iii. The SMAP Sea Surface Salinity observed at {t} rsub {f} -14 is interpolated onto the particle positions that day.
- iv. With this, each particle has an SSS value on {t} rsub {f} day that corresponds to the observation at {t} rsub {f} -14 .

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm
- The algorithm is called Lagrangian Reconstruction Technique. User should refer [1].
Limitations
- This algorithm is applicable only in the region with moderate to high eddy kinetic energy and where lateral advection dominates.
High resolution sea surface salinity product generated by Lagrangian technique can have error due to tracer bias (depends on accuracy of initial conditions) and advection bias (Passive stirring can introduce bias due to mixing physics (air-sea fluxes, mixing etc.)).
Known problems with data
- Data sets have biases as well as inaccuracy.

| 6 | Abstract | Lagrangian technique is used for generating high-resolution sea surface salinity fields in the Bay of Bengal. This is achieved through the utilization of Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) data derived from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, in conjunction with sea surface currents obtained from altimetry. By employing forward and backward schemes for the numerical advection of SMAP SSS fields using altimeter-derived geostrophic currents, a Lagrangian reconstruction is produced, capturing smaller-scale features. The reliability of our in-house developed algorithm is assessed by comparing it with an available reconstructed product in the Gulf Stream. Additionally, a preliminary validation is conducted against insitu data obtained from a thermo-salinograph. Further, the developed algorithm was modified to select the advection time dynamically. |
