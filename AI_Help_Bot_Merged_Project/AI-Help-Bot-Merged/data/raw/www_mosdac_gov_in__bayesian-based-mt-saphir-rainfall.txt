Megha- Tropiques (MT) is a joint Indo-French collaborative satellite mission, which is launched on 12 October 2011. The main objective of MT is to get more understanding on convective system, energy exchange and water cycle in the tropical region. It is equipped with Microwave Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric Structures (MADRAS) (not in operational), Scanner for Radiation Budget, Radio Occultation Sensor for Atmosphere and Sondeur Atmospherique du Profil d’Humidite Intertropical par Radiometrie (SAPHIR). SAPHIR provides clear sky atmospheric humidity profiles at 6-channels near 183.31GHz water vapour resonance. The observations of SAPHIR provides an opportunity to estimate rainfall using 183.31GHz channels. A Bayesian based rainfall retrieval technique is developed using SAPHIR channel-6 (183.31±11GHz) brightness temperature observations. Estimated rainfall has been validated with IMERG and DPR products during Jan-Dec 2017. The global distribution of rainfall patterns are captured well by the estimation.
