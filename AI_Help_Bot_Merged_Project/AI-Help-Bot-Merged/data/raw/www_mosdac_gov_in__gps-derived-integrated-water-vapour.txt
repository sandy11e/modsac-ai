This dataset contains Integrated Water Vapor (IWV) estimates derived from GPS receivers that comprise the GAGAN TEC network. These receivers have been installed at airports at various locations in India. The Zenith Tropospheric Delay was estimated from the GPS observations using the GAMIT software. Further, IWV was estimated from the ZTD values using surface temperature and pressure from ERA-I reanalysis as additional inputs. The GAGAN-IWV estimates for 1 year – March 2013 to February 2014 – have currently been made available.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm
- Described in the report titled “Demonstration of GNSS-based short-range forecasting of rainfall”
Limitations
- The IWV estimates constitute a conical average of variable shape and orientation depending on the location of available GPS satellites.
Known problems with data
- No known issues at this time.
File Naming Convention
