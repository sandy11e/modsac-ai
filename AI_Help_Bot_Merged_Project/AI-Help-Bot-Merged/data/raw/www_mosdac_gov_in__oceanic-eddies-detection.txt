The oceanic eddy parameter information was prepared for 24 years (1993 – 2016) over Bay of Bengal using AVISO. Merged and gridded satellite altimeter product of sea surface height (SSH) anomaly at 7-day interval having special resolution of 0.25o has been used for present study. Mesoscale oceanic eddies have been identified and tracked in weekly merged altimeter product of Sea Surface Height (SSH) from AVISO. Eddies have been identified based on closed contour approach followed by shape criteria. An automated tracking algorithm has been employed to track these eddies with different lifetime. The trajectories of eddies have been computed from their time history. Present method has been used separately for cold core and warm core eddies. There are 24 files each containing weekly eddy data information for individual year.

Data Version
- Version 1.0 (beta)
Data Sources
- The daily gridded map of Absolute Dynamic Topography data is obtained from AVISO
- ftp site (ftp://ftp.aviso.oceanobs.com)
- Website (http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/)
Processing Steps
- Remove the long wavelength component of the SSH anomaly and retain the mesoscale features with the wavelength 50-500 km scale.
- Identified outer most closed contour of SSH anomaly.
- The closed contours are sequentially identified, analysed and checked essential criteria.
- Size and amplitude based thresholds for eddy detection were fixed after carrying out several trials.
- Eddies are detected and calculated the eddy parameters.
- Detected eddies are tracked individually.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm
- We have followed Chelton et. Al. 2007 in deriving the eddy census in Bay of Bengal with minor modifications in fixing the thresholds for eddy detection specific to this region. This was achieved after performing several trial experiments with different combinations of size and amplitude values.
Limitations
- Accuracy assessment of the dataset has not been carried out. The number of eddies are depending upon the diameter and amplitude threshold. Only mesoscale eddies with maximum diameter of 400km are being considered.
Known problems with data
- Less reliability of SSH data near the coast with altimetry is a known problem.

File Naming Convention
- The typical file name is 'eddy_parameter_YYYY.nc' or ‘YYYY.gif’ where
- 'eddy_parameter’ signifies that this product consists of eddy parameters.
- 'YYYY' corresponds to the year, ex: 2015.
- All the data files are in NetCDF 4 format and the images are in gif format.
