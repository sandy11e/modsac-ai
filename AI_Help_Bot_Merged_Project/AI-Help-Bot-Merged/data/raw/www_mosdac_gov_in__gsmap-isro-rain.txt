The GSMaP_ISRO is a precipitation product that was developed through the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) - Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Implementation of Agreement (IA) specifically for the Indian subcontinent. It is currently available from March 2000 Onwards and offers a horizontal resolution of 0.1°X 0.1° on a latitude/longitude grid with a temporal resolution of 1 hour. The dataset is based on the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) algorithm (Kubota et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2021, 2022) with Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) gauge correction, and is a specialized product that focuses on the Indian landmass. The GSMaP algorithm, designed by the JAXA, is instrumental in creating a comprehensive view of precipitation using microwave radiometers and cloud moving data from Geostationary Infrared (IR) technology. The algorithm is separated into three primary categories for effective measurement: the microwave imager, microwave sounder, and microwave-infrared (MVK) combined (Mega et al. 2019). A detailed verification of GSMaP_ISRO for the Indian summer monsoon periods of 2000-2020 against ground, satellite and various merge rainfall products is presented in Kumar et al. (2022).

| 6 | Abstract | The GSMaP_ISRO rain data has been derived through the IMD gauge based gridded rain & NOAA CPC gauge analysis adjustment of the GSMaP_MVK rain product. It offers high-quality rainfall information with excellent spatiotemporal resolution, covering a range spanning from March 2000 Onwards. It has been developed through the ISRO-JAXA Implementation of Agreement (IA). This product provides a lat/long grid with a 0.1° X 0.1° horizontal resolution, along with hourly temporal resolution. |
