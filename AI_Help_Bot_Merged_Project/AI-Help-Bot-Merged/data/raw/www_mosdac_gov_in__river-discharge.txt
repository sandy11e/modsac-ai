River heights from satellite altimeters (ENVISAT, Jason-2 and SARAL AltiKa) have been derived at two cross-over points along Godavari River. Subsequently, river height discharge stage relationship between altimetry derived heights and In-situ river discharge has been established. Using this relationship, river discharge database for Godavari River for the period i.e. 2002 - 2015 has been generated.

Data Version
- Version 1.0 (beta)
Data Sources
1. GDR tracked data of ENVISAT and Jason-2 (PISTACH Hydrology) at Yanam (estuarine side) and Bhadrachalam (riverine side) for the entire period of respective missions were obtained from
a. ENVISAT website(http://earth.esa.int/)
b.AVISO website(http://www.avisooceanobs.com)(Jason-2)
2. SARAL/AltiKa data were obtained from MOSDAC website (http://www.mosdac.gov.in)
Processing Steps
- The given range was corrected for
- path delay in the atmosphere through which the radar pulse passes
- the nature of the reflecting sea surface
- All range corrections are added to the range
- Rating curve methodology was developed between Altimeter river height and in-situ river discharge (Rantz et al. 1982).

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm
- The observed river height with respect to geoid is given by
- Rh= Hsat-(R+Cw+Cd+Ci+Cst+Cp) (1)
- Where
- Hsat represents the satellite altitude with respect to reference ellipsoid
- R represents the satellite range
- Cw(w for wet tropospheric)and Cd (d for dry tropospheric) are corrections for delayed propagation in the atmosphere
- Ci is the correction delayed propagation through the ionosphere
- Cst and Cp represents the correction for solid and polar tides respectively.
Limitations
- Based on the availability of the Altimeter dataset over the study region (data gap, altimeter track loss, loss of flooding events, etc.).
Known problems with data
- Data problems due to bad weather (heavy rain)
Related data collections
- Limited daily in-situ river discharge data (2007 - 2012) available along Godavari River were obtained from Dowlaiswaram Dam Authorities, Andhra Pradesh.
- Hourly river heights/water levels were provided by Dr. Prakash Mehra, NIO Radar gauge at Yanam (Godavari Estuary) for the period 2008 - 2010.
